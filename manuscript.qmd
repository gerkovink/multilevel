# Outline

1. missing data occur often in data with human subjects
2. missing data may be resolved, but need to be handled in accordance with the analysis of scientific interest
3. in human-subjects research, there is often clustering, which may be captured with multilevel modeling techniques
4. if the analysis of scientific interest is a multilevel model, the missing data handling method should accommodate the multilevel structure of the data
4. both missingness and multilevel structures require advanced statistical techniques
5. this tutorial sets out to facilitate empirical researchers in accommodating both multilevel structures as well as missing data
6. we illustrate the use of the software by means of a case study
